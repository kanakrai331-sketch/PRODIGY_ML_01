# **Project Title** 

"Task 01 - House Price Prediction using Linear Regression | Prodigy Infotech ML Internship"

# 👤  **About Me**

I am Kanak Rai, a Machine Learning Intern at Prodigy Infotech.
I am passionate about data science and machine learning, with a strong interest in building predictive models using real-world datasets.
This project reflects my understanding of:
Data preprocessing
Feature selection
Linear regression modeling
Model evaluation techniques

# 📘 **Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to build a Linear Regression model that predicts house prices based on important housing features.
The model uses numerical attributes such as:

* Square footage of the house

* Number of bedrooms

* Number of bathrooms

* By analyzing these features, the model learns patterns that help estimate the market
  price of a house.

  This task is a part of the **Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy Infotech**

# 📊 **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques dataset.
Source: Kaggle
Dataset Link:
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

Key Features Used-

* GrLivArea: Above-ground living area (square feet)
  
* BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms
  
* FullBath: Number of full bathrooms
  
* Target Variable
  
* SalePrice: Final selling price of the house

# 🤖 **Machine Learning Model**

Algorithm Used: Linear Regression
The model is trained using selected numerical features and evaluated to understand how accurately it predicts house prices.
Evaluation Metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score

# 📈 **Insights**

House prices increase significantly with an increase in square footage.
The number of bedrooms and bathrooms positively impacts the house value.
Linear Regression serves as a strong baseline model for price prediction problems.
